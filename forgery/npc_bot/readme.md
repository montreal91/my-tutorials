## NPC Bot

My very first take on bots based on semantic knowledge bases inspired by
[this paper](https://suchanek.name/work/publications/www2007.pdf) by
[Fabian Suchanek](https://suchanek.name/) and others.

The goal is to make a bot fun to chat with and this bot is a starting point.

#### Current description
Right now bot is a console program which gives only one answer at a time.
There are also limitations on what could be asked.
Affordable question types are:
* What is <X>
* Is <X> <Y>

Right now this bot doesn't know much.
X and Y could only be:
* person
* scientist
* verner
* heisenberg

On everything else bot comlains it doesn't know given thing.
