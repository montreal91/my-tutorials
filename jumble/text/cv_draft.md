# About me (WIP, DRAFT)

I am a perpetually improving Software Engineer with a bachelor degree in applied mathematics.

My biggest professional motivation is to create robust software with clean architecture, clean design and clean code.

Recently I've got fond of philosophy: a programmer does not have a goal, only the way.
This practically means that I always learn and will never stop.
And it renders my current state rather meamingless, because what I don't know today I will do tomorrow and so on and on.

## Projects
All projects I took part in at this point, except academic one, are managed by Agile methologies with 1-2 week sprints.
Maintenance tasks (various bug fixes and minor impovements) usually take from 4 hours up to three days, rarely more.
Significant improvements take 1-2 weeks.

Interesting note.
In all projects I tend to create more tasks than I solve.

### Pearlchain (Pearlchain)
Stack: Java, Spring, Hibernate.

The goal of the project is to provide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution for production of higly customized products,
taking into account real-time maufacturing capacities.

At the beginning of the project all my tasks were mainenance,
but once I've got used to the project, its philosophy and key concepts, I started to do refactoring and redesign of different systems.

My favorite task was to replace old naive implementation of in-house Domain-Specific Language (DSL) with a new one
which would allow easier maintenance and extension of the said DSL.
Original estimation was two weeks, but it took me three times more to pull it off and I don't regret a single day spent on this task.
First of all, I decoupled the old subsystem from the other system and designed a narrow interface.
Only using this interface the other code can communicate with the DSL subsystem.
This allowed me to isolate my changes from the other code and hide implementation details behind the interface.

It was the first time when I was using principles of R. C. Martin's clean architecture on such scale and it was great,
because benifits of such approach soon were proven to be useful.

That task left me exhausted so I decided to step back a little. Needed to recover,
and to get an overview of my previous career, read books and craft my pet projects to test new concepts.
