# About me (WIP, DRAFT)

I am a perpetually improving Software Engineer with a bachelor degree in applied mathematics.

My biggest professional motivation is to create robust software with clean architecture, clean design and clean code.

Recently I've got fond of philosophy: a programmer does not have a goal, only the way.
This practically means that I always learn and will never stop.
And it renders my current state rather meamingless, because what I don't know today I will do tomorrow and so on and on.

## Projects
All projects I took part in at this point, except academic one, are managed by Agile methologies with 1-2 week sprints.
Maintenance tasks (various bug fixes and minor impovements) usually take from 4 hours up to three days, rarely more.
Significant improvements take 1-2 weeks.

### PearlChain, Novosibirsk — Java Software Engineer
*January 2020 — December 2020*

PearlChain — general ERP solution for production of non-serial products taking into account real-time manufacturing capacities.

Automotive — specific solution for automotive industry based on PearlChain.

Tech Stack: Java, Spring, Hibernate.

* Developed from scratch DSL interpreter;
* Redesigned interfaces between subsystems;
* Developed subsystems from scratch;
* Refactored subsystems;
* Refactored and simplified complicated algorithms;
* Proposed a lot of improvements which were implemented later by other team members;
* Code review;


### Naumen, Chelyabinsk — Intern/Junior Java Software Engineer
July 2016 — November 2016

Naumen Service Desk — a solution for automation of management process in IT and service maintenance of production.

Stack: Java, Spring, Hibernate

* Learned basic patterns of enterprise applications;
* Developed minor features;
* Fixed bugs;
* Wrote migration scripts;

### Graduation Project (Chelyabinsk State University)
TBA

### Electronic Educational Systems (BARS Group)
Stack: Python, Django ORM

The goal of the project is to automate processes in Russian education system.

Most of the time I did maintenance. Once upon a time I got a bigger improvement task and failed it
(not completely; I produced required solution, but took too much time). Then another one.
After several failures all I did was maintenance and writing of unit-tests.

I stuck in routine tasks, stuck with my personal development,
and it didn't feel like I add enough value to the project.
In this situation the obvious decision was to move over, so I did.


### Db2 Cloning Tool (Complex Systems)
Stack: High-Level Assembly (HLASM), bare IBM hardware and a bit of C/C++.

The goal of the project is to make possible cloning various Db2 subsystems with minimal (or no) downtime.

Because this project is written with low-level language, it has much longer 4-week sprints.
Usual maintenance tasks like  bugfixes and minor improvements took a whole working week to make and significant improvements were made within a month or more.

Here for the first 3-4 weeks I learned HLASM and basic IBM mainframe workflow.
Later and till the end of my work with this project all I did was mantenance and bug reporting.

In general, I liked to work with machine language and bare metal,
but at the time IBM was withdrawing all development from Russia,
so I have had to look for another job.
