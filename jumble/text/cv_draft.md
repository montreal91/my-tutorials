# About me (WIP, DRAFT)

I am a perpetually improving Software Engineer with a bachelor degree in applied mathematics.

My biggest professional motivation is to create robust software with clean architecture, clean design and clean code.

Recently I've got fond of philosophy: a programmer does not have a goal, only the way.
This practically means that I always learn and will never stop.
And it renders my current state rather meamingless, because what I don't know today I will do tomorrow and so on and on.
