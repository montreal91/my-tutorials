This file contains links and notes to the leetcode problems that I've solved perfect, bad or fine.

* **Perfect**: Problem is solved within one hour and passed from the first attempt.
* **Fine**: Problem is solved within two hours or has failed attempts.
* **Bad**: Problem is not solved within two hours by myself and I looked up the solution.

It's good to revisit problems after 4 months.
